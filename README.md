    --name headphones \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    --volume ${PWD}/app:/app \
    --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    --volume ${PWD}/config:/config \
    --volume ${PWD}/torrents:/torrents \

### Volume mounts


- `/config` : oore config directory contain `config.ini`
- `/torrents` : torrent watch and data directory  *[arbitrary]*
- `/usenet` :  usenet watch and data directory *[arbitrary]*
- `/Media/Music` : Tagged Music aftert post-process *[arbitrary]*

You should create directory before run the container otherwise directories are created by the docker deamon and owned by the root user

### Environment variables

To change the timezone of the container set the `TZ` environment variable. The full list of available options can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

You can also set the `HOME` environment variable this is usefull to get in the right directory when you attach a shell in your docker container.


### Docker Compose

[`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) can help with defining the `docker run` config in a repeatable way rather than ensuring you always pass the same CLI arguments.

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` config:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  headphones:
    image: j33r/headphones:latest    
    user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - HOME=/app
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config \
      - ./torrents:/torrents \
      - ./usenet:/usenet \
      - ./Media:/Media
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    ports:
      - 8181:8181
```
